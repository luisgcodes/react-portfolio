          <p>Hello, I'm Luis â€” An Aspiring Software Engineer who is on the road to specialize in Front-End Development.</p>
          <p>Front-end development caught my attention late of 2021 and ever since it has kept it's grip on me. I began to do research and soon decided to go the "Self Taught" route but I knew that if I wanted to get the most out of the early stages of my journey, I should enroll in a bootcamp and that's what I did.</p>
          {}
          <p>Apart from this new found love, I enjoy gaming and finding new ways to become as creative as I can be with the things I get into. I've dipped my toes in photography, photoshop, video editing, designing and producing shirts/decals.</p>
